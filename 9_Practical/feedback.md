## Major Problems?
Transfer learning not that clear for us while implementing it. For different models maybe we need to know the goal behind different to-dos.

## Helpful?
Absolutely, especially the topic in theoretical phase was too much for us to digest.

## Duration (hours)?

_Please make a list where every student in your group puts in the hours they used to do the complete exercise_
_Example: [5.5, 4, 7], if one of you took 5 and a half hours, one person 4 and the other 7. The order does not matter._
_This feedback will help us analyze which exercise sheets are too time-intensive._

[6 8]
